    "hook": "When Target suffered its massive 2013 breach, the company had security tools that detected the intrusion. They had policies requiring response. But governance failures meant alerts weren't escalated, policies weren't followed, and 40 million credit cards were stolen. After the breach, Target's CEO and CIO both lost their jobsâ€”not because the security technology failed, but because the governance structure failed. Security governance isn't bureaucracy; it's the framework that ensures security actually happens. Without it, policies are just paper and tools are just expensive software.",

It's how organizations move from 'we have security tools' to 'we have effective security.' Governance defines who's responsible, what rules apply, and how success is measured. Expect 4-6 Security+ questions on policies, standards, procedures, roles, and governance structures."
