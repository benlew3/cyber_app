    "hook": "In 2017, Equifax disclosed that attackers had accessed personal information of 147 million peopleâ€”names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and driver's license numbers. The breach resulted in $700 million in settlements. But the true cost was immeasurable: millions of people's most sensitive identifiers exposed, enabling identity theft for years to come. Data is often called the 'new oil,' but unlike oil, once data leaks, it can never be contained again. Protecting data isn't just about complianceâ€”it's about protecting people.",
