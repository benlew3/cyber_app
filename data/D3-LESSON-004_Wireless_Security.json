    "hook": "In 2007, hackers stole 45 million credit card numbers from TJX Companies (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls) by exploiting weak WEP encryption on store wireless networks. They sat in parking lots with laptops and antennas, cracked the encryption in minutes, and had access to corporate systems for over 18 months. The breach cost TJX over $256 million. Wireless networks extend your perimeter into parking lots, neighboring buildings, and the air itself. Without proper security, attackers don't even need to set foot in your building.",
