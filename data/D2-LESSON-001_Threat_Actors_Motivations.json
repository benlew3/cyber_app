    "hook": "In 2023, a single ransomware group called LockBit attacked over 1,700 organizations across 30 countries, extorting over $91 million in ransom payments. Meanwhile, a 17-year-old in his bedroom breached Uber and Rockstar Games just to prove he could. Nation-state hackers from China, Russia, and North Korea conducted sophisticated espionage campaigns against governments and corporations worldwide. Understanding WHO is attacking you is just as important as understanding HOW they attackâ€”because their identity shapes their capabilities, persistence, and objectives.",

      "Classify threat actors by type, capability, and sophistication",
      "Analyze attacker motivations including financial, political, and ideological goals",
      "Differentiate between internal and external threats",
      "Assess threat actor resources, funding, and persistence levels",
      "Apply threat actor knowledge to inform defensive strategies"
    ],
    "why_it_matters": "Security isn't one-size-fits-allâ€”your defenses should be calibrated to the threats you actually face. A hospital faces different threat actors than a defense contractor, which faces different threats than a small retail business. Understanding threat actors helps you prioritize defenses, allocate resources, and make informed risk decisions. The Security+ exam dedicates significant coverage to threat actorsâ€”expect 5-7 questions on actor types, motivations, and characteristics."
