    "hook": "In 2017, a misconfigured Amazon S3 bucket exposed 198 million American voter recordsâ€”names, addresses, phone numbers, and political preferences. The data wasn't stolen by hackers; it was simply left unprotected and publicly accessible. The company that compiled it had no idea the exposure existed until a security researcher found it. Data protection isn't just about stopping attackersâ€”it's about knowing where your sensitive data is, classifying it properly, and ensuring it's protected at every stage of its lifecycle.",
