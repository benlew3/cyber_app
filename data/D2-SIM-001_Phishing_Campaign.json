Three separate users from the Finance department have reported suspicious emails claiming to be from the CFO requesting urgent wire transfers. Within 20 minutes, you've received seven more reports from various departments - HR, Patient Billing, and the Executive Assistant pool. The emails appear highly targeted, referencing specific internal projects and using proper formatting that mirrors legitimate internal communications. Your SOC Lead assigns you as primary analyst for this incident. Initial triage suggests this isn't opportunistic spam - someone has done their homework on MedCare."
