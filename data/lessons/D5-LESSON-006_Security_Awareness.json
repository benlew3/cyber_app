    "hook": "In 2020, Twitter's massive breach didn't start with a sophisticated zero-day exploit or state-sponsored hackers. It started with a phone call. Attackers called Twitter employees, pretended to be IT support, and convinced them to provide credentials. With those credentials, they accessed internal tools and took over accounts belonging to Elon Musk, Barack Obama, and Apple. Technical controls failed because humans were the target. Security awareness transforms employees from the weakest link into an active defense layer.",
