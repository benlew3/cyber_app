    "hook": "When the Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) hit in December 2021, organizations faced an impossible choice: patch immediately (breaking production systems) or remain vulnerable to active exploitation. The answer wasn't either/or - it was mitigation. WAF rules blocked exploitation attempts while teams tested patches. Network segmentation limited blast radius. Egress filtering prevented callback connections. Organizations that had mitigation capabilities bought critical time; those without scrambled or got breached.",

When a critical vulnerability is discovered, immediate patching may not be possible - systems need testing, change windows must be scheduled, legacy systems may not have patches. Mitigation buys time by reducing exploitability or limiting impact without fully fixing the root cause. The goal is risk reduction to an acceptable level while permanent solutions are developed.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts is critical for exam success and real-world application. Security professionals encounter these scenarios regularly, making mastery essential. The key aspects to remember include: Mitigation = temporary risk reduction (compensating control). Additionally, Remediation = permanent fix (patch, code fix, replacement) represents another crucial element.
