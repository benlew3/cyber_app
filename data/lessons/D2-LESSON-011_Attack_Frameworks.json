    "hook": "When you understand how attackers think, you can anticipate their next move. Attack frameworks like the Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK aren't just academic exercises - they're battle-tested models that describe how real attacks unfold. SOC analysts use them to prioritize alerts (reconnaissance is less urgent than lateral movement). Incident responders use them to predict attacker behavior. Red teamers use them to plan realistic attacks. These frameworks transform chaos into understandable patterns.",

Weaponization: creating malicious payload. Delivery: transmitting weapon to target. Exploitation: triggering the vulnerability. Installation: establishing persistence. Command & Control: establishing communication channel. Actions on Objectives: achieving the attacker's goal. Defense strategy: disrupt at the earliest possible phase - stopping reconnaissance prevents everything that follows.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts is critical for exam success and real-world application. Security professionals encounter these scenarios regularly, making mastery essential. The key aspects to remember include: Seven phases: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, C2, Actions. Additionally, Earlier disruption is more effective - stop recon to prevent everything represents another crucial element. Organizations implementing these practices see measurable improvements in their security posture. Regular review and hands-on practice reinforce these concepts for long-term retention.",
