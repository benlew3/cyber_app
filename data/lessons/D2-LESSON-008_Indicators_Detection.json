    "hook": "When SolarWinds was breached in 2020, the attackers operated undetected for NINE MONTHS inside thousands of organizations including US government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. Why did traditional security tools miss it? Because they relied primarily on IOCs - indicators of KNOWN threats - and these attackers used novel techniques with no existing signatures. The attackers even named their malware to blend with legitimate SolarWinds files. This breach proved that effective detection requires understanding both IOCs (evidence of what happened) and IOAs (behavior patterns of what's happening) - combining signature-based detection with behavioral analysis to catch threats before catastrophic damage occurs.",

Common IOC types include file hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) that uniquely identify malicious files, IP addresses of command-and-control servers, domain names used in attacks, URLs hosting malware, registry key modifications, mutex names used by malware for persistence, and email artifacts like sender addresses and subject lines. IOCs are reactive by nature - they help you detect KNOWN threats after security researchers have analyzed attacks and published indicators. The critical limitation: attackers constantly change indicators. An IP address used today will be different tomorrow. A file hash changes with the slightest modification. This is why IOC-only detection has limited effectiveness against sophisticated adversaries who rotate infrastructure frequently.",

Behavioral analysis (heuristic detection) looks for sequences of actions matching attack patterns rather than single anomalies - more context-aware than pure anomaly detection.
