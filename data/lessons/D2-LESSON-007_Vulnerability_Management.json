A known vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638 in Apache Struts) that had a patch available for TWO MONTHS before the breach. This isn't unusual - Verizon's DBIR consistently shows that most breaches exploit vulnerabilities with patches available for months or years. The difference between secure organizations and breached ones often comes down to one thing: effective vulnerability management.

Assessment determines severity by combining CVSS scores with environmental context and business impact. Remediation applies fixes through patching, compensating controls, or risk acceptance. Reporting tracks progress, demonstrates due diligence, and satisfies compliance requirements. Organizations that treat vulnerability management as a one-time project inevitably fail; those that build sustainable programs with clear ownership, SLAs, and metrics succeed.
