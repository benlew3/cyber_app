    "hook": "In 2020, a red team assessment at a major financial institution discovered that an attacker could reach the SWIFT payment system in just 4 steps from an unpatched workstation. The finding was critical - but it was found by defenders, not attackers. Security assessments - vulnerability scans, penetration tests, and red team exercises - find weaknesses before adversaries do. The difference between a breach and a finding is often just who discovers the vulnerability first.",

Vulnerability assessments use automated tools to identify potential weaknesses - fast and broad but shallow. Penetration testing manually exploits vulnerabilities to prove real-world impact - deeper but narrower scope. Red team engagements simulate real adversaries with full tactics, techniques, and procedures - tests people, process, and technology together. Each serves different purposes: vuln scans for inventory, pen tests for validation, red teams for holistic assessment.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts is critical for exam success and real-world application. Security professionals encounter these scenarios regularly, making mastery essential. The key aspects to remember include: Vulnerability Scan: Automated, broad, identifies potential issues. Additionally, Penetration Test: Manual exploitation, proves real-world impact represents another crucial element.
