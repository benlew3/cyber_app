Always use LDAPS (encrypted).\n\n*RADIUS:* Network access (VPN, wireless). AAA: Authentication, Authorization, Accounting.\n\n*TACACS+:* Cisco alternative to RADIUS. Encrypts entire payload.\n\n**Federation Standards**\n\n*SAML:* XML-based enterprise SSO. IdP authenticates, SPs trust assertions.\n\n*OAuth 2.0:* AUTHORIZATION framework (not authentication!). Grants access without sharing credentials.\n\n*OpenID Connect:* Authentication built ON OAuth. Adds identity to OAuth. Modern SAML alternative.\n\n**Key Concepts**\n\n*Single Sign-On:* One auth grants access to multiple systems. Risk: single point of compromise.\n\n*Identity Provider (IdP):* Authenticates users, issues assertions (Okta, Azure AD).\n\n*Service Provider (SP):* Application relying on IdP for authentication.",
