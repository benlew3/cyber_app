    "hook": "The Equifax breach exposed 147 million Americans' personal data, including Social Security numbers. The cause? A known vulnerability in Apache Struts that had a patch available for two months before the breach. Equifax knew about it, had been notified, but didn't patch in time. Most breaches don't exploit zero-day vulnerabilitiesâ€”they exploit known vulnerabilities that organizations failed to remediate. Vulnerability management isn't glamorous, but it's one of the most effective security practices: find weaknesses before attackers do, prioritize what matters most, and fix it before it's exploited.",
    "learning_goals": [
      "Understand the vulnerability management lifecycle from discovery to verification",
      "Interpret vulnerability severity using CVSS scores and risk-based prioritization",
      "Differentiate between vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and bug bounties",
      "Apply context and asset criticality to vulnerability prioritization",
      "Implement effective remediation strategies including patching and compensating controls"
    ],
    "why_it_matters": "Every organization has vulnerabilitiesâ€”the question is whether you find and fix them before attackers exploit them. Vulnerability management is a core security function that directly reduces risk. Whether you're running scans, interpreting reports, or prioritizing remediation, understanding vulnerability management is essential. The Security+ exam tests this extensivelyâ€”expect 6-8 questions on scanning, CVSS, prioritization, and remediation."
