    "hook": "Every security decision you'll ever makeâ€”whether choosing a firewall, designing an authentication system, or responding to an incidentâ€”ultimately comes down to protecting three things: keeping secrets secret, ensuring data hasn't been tampered with, and making sure systems are accessible when needed. These three pillarsâ€”Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availabilityâ€”form the foundation of information security. Miss any one of them, and your security program has a critical gap.",
    "learning_goals": [
      "Apply the CIA Triad to analyze security scenarios and identify protection gaps",
      "Distinguish between confidentiality, integrity, and availability controls",
      "Explain non-repudiation and its role in security and legal contexts",
      "Implement the AAA framework (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) in access control scenarios",
      "Recognize how Security+ exam questions test CIA Triad concepts"
    ],
    "why_it_matters": "The CIA Triad isn't just theoryâ€”it's the lens through which security professionals view every problem. When a SOC analyst triages an alert, they're assessing CIA impact. When a security engineer designs a system, they're ensuring CIA across all components. When an auditor evaluates controls, they're mapping them to CIA objectives. Understanding these fundamentals is essential for your exam and your career."

      "content": "The AAA framework provides a systematic approach to access control: verifying identity (Authentication), determining permissions (Authorization), and tracking activity (Accounting). These three functions work together to control and monitor access to resources.\n\n**Authentication: Who Are You?**\nAuthentication verifies the claimed identity of a user, device, or process. It answers: 'Are you who you claim to be?'\n\n*Authentication Factors:*\n- **Something you know**: Password, PIN, security questions\n- **Something you have**: Smart card, token, phone\n- **Something you are**: Fingerprint, retina, voice\n- **Somewhere you are**: Location, IP address, GPS coordinates\n- **Something you do**: Typing pattern, gait, behavior\n\n*Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):*\nUsing two or more DIFFERENT factors. Critical distinction: two passwords is NOT MFA (both are 'something you know'). True MFA combines factors from different categories.\n\nExamples:\n- Password + SMS code (know + have)\n- Smart card + PIN (have + know)\n- Fingerprint + token (are + have)\n\n**Authorization: What Can You Do?**\nAuthorization determines what authenticated users are permitted to access. It answers: 'What are you allowed to do?'\n\nAuthorization happens AFTER authenticationâ€”you must prove your identity before the system can determine your permissions.\n\n*Authorization Models:*\n- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**: Owner determines access\n- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**: System-enforced based on labels\n- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Permissions based on job function\n- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Dynamic rules based on attributes\n\n*Principle of Least Privilege:*\nUsers should have only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their job functions. No more, no less.\n\n**Accounting: What Did You Do?**\nAccounting tracks and records user activities for audit, billing, or security purposes. It answers: 'What actions were taken?'\n\n*Accounting Functions:*\n- Session tracking (login/logout times)\n- Resource usage (bandwidth, storage, compute)\n- Actions performed (files accessed, commands executed)\n- Changes made (configurations altered, data modified)\n\n*Security Uses:*\n- Forensic investigation after incidents\n- Compliance audit evidence\n- User behavior analytics\n- Billing and chargeback\n\n**AAA Protocols**\n\n*RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service):*\n- Combines authentication and authorization in Access-Accept\n- Separate accounting messages\n- UDP-based (ports 1812/1813)\n- Encrypts only passwords, not entire session\n\n*TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus):*\n- Separates authentication, authorization, and accounting\n- TCP-based (port 49)\n- Encrypts entire packet\n- More flexible and granular than RADIUS\n\n*Common Usage:*\n- RADIUS: Common for network access (VPN, WiFi)\n- TACACS+: Common for device administration (routers, switches)",
