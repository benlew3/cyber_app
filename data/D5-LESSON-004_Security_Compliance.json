    "hook": "In 2019, British Airways was fined Â£183 million under GDPR for a data breach affecting 500,000 customers. The fine wasn't just about the breachâ€”it was about the airline's failure to implement adequate security measures required by regulation. Marriott faced a Â£99 million fine for similar reasons. These aren't isolated cases. Compliance has evolved from a checklist exercise to a business-critical function with existential consequences. Understanding compliance isn't optionalâ€”it's how organizations avoid regulatory catastrophe.",

Regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and SOX mandate specific security controls with significant penalties for non-compliance. Security professionals must understand these requirements and how to demonstrate compliance. Expect 4-6 Security+ questions on regulatory requirements, compliance monitoring, and the relationship between security frameworks and regulations."
