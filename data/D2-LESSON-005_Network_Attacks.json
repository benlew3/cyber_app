  "introduction": {
    "hook": "In October 2016, the Mirai botnet launched the largest DDoS attack in history, taking down Twitter, Netflix, Reddit, and CNN by flooding Dyn's DNS infrastructure with traffic from millions of compromised IoT devices. Network attacks strike at the foundation of connectivity itself—without networks, modern organizations simply cannot function. Understanding how attackers exploit network protocols, intercept traffic, and overwhelm services is essential for defending the digital highways that connect everything.",
    
    "learning_goals": [
      "Identify DoS, DDoS, and amplification attack techniques",
      "Analyze man-in-the-middle attacks (ARP poisoning, DNS spoofing)",
      "Understand on-path attacks and session hijacking",
      "Detect network attacks using packet analysis",
      "Implement appropriate defenses against network-based threats"
    ],
    
    "why_it_matters": "Networks carry all data and enable all communication. Network attacks can intercept sensitive data, disrupt operations, and redirect traffic. As a security professional, you'll configure firewalls, implement segmentation, and respond to network incidents. The Security+ exam covers network attacks extensively—expect 6-8 questions.",
    
    "career_relevance": {
      "soc_analyst": "You'll investigate alerts for network attacks like DDoS, ARP spoofing, and DNS anomalies. Understanding attack patterns helps you distinguish real attacks from false positives and assess severity.",
      "incident_responder": "Network forensics is crucial for investigations. You'll analyze packet captures, trace attack origins, and determine what data may have been intercepted or exfiltrated.",
      "grc_analyst": "Understanding network attack risks helps you assess controls and compliance. DDoS resilience, network segmentation, and encryption requirements are common audit topics.",
      "penetration_tester": "Network attacks are part of your toolkit. You'll conduct ARP spoofing, MITM attacks, and network reconnaissance during engagements to test defenses.",
      "security_engineer": "You'll implement IDS/IPS, configure firewalls, design network segmentation, and deploy DDoS protection. Understanding attacks helps you tune detection and prevention."
