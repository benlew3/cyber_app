    "hook": "In 2019, a major financial services company discovered that their most sophisticated cyber defenses were meaningless when a contractor simply walked into their data center, plugged in a USB device, and walked out with gigabytes of customer data. The server room had no visitor logs, the badge system wasn't monitored, and the USB ports hadn't been disabled. Physical security isn't just about locks and guardsâ€”it's the foundation upon which all other security controls depend. If an attacker can touch your systems, they can own your systems.",
