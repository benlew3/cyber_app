    "hook": "In 2017, attackers walked into a corporate office wearing fake vendor badges and installed rogue network devices on the network. No malware needed - just confidence and a reflective vest. Physical security isn't glamorous, but it's often the weakest link. The most sophisticated encryption means nothing if someone can walk out with your server. Physical and logical security must work together.",

    "why_it_matters": "Physical security protects people, facilities, and tangible assets - including the hardware that runs your logical security. Data centers, server rooms, and workstations all need physical protection. As a security professional, you'll assess physical controls, identify gaps, and recommend improvements. On the exam, expect 3-5 questions on physical security controls and concepts.",
