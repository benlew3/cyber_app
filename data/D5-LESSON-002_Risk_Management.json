    "hook": "In 2017, Equifax knew about the Apache Struts vulnerability that would eventually expose 147 million records. They assessed the risk and scheduled patchingâ€”but they scheduled it too slowly. The breach wasn't a failure to identify risk; it was a failure to properly assess and treat it. Risk management isn't about eliminating all riskâ€”that's impossible. It's about understanding which risks matter most and making informed decisions about how to handle them. The organizations that master risk management don't prevent every incident, but they prevent the catastrophic ones.",

It's the language that connects security to business, enabling conversations about investment, acceptance, and trade-offs. Expect 5-7 Security+ questions on risk concepts, assessment methods, treatment options, and risk communication."
