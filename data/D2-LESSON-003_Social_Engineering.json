  "introduction": {
    "hook": "In 2020, a 17-year-old hacker didn't use zero-day exploits or sophisticated malware to breach Twitter. He simply called employees, convinced them he was from the IT department, and talked them into giving up credentials. Within hours, he controlled the accounts of Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Joe Biden, and Appleâ€”posting bitcoin scams to 350 million followers. The most powerful security technology is worthless when humans can be convinced to bypass it. Social engineering attacks target the human mind, exploiting trust, fear, curiosity, and helpfulness to manipulate people into compromising security.",
    "learning_goals": [
      "Identify social engineering attack techniques including phishing, pretexting, and baiting",
      "Recognize psychological principles attackers exploit (authority, urgency, social proof)",
      "Differentiate between various phishing variants (spear phishing, whaling, smishing, vishing)",
      "Analyze real-world social engineering scenarios to identify red flags",
      "Implement technical and human-based defenses against social engineering"
    ],
    "why_it_matters": "Social engineering is involved in over 90% of successful cyber attacks. Every employee is a potential target and a potential vulnerability. As a security professional, you'll design awareness programs, test users with simulated attacks, and implement technical controls to reduce social engineering risk. The Security+ exam heavily emphasizes social engineeringâ€”expect 8-10 questions on techniques, psychology, and defenses."
