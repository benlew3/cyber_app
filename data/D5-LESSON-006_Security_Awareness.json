  "introduction": {
    "hook": "In 2020, Twitter's massive breach didn't start with a sophisticated zero-day exploit or state-sponsored hackers. It started with a phone call. Attackers called Twitter employees, pretended to be IT support, and convinced them to provide credentials. With those credentials, they accessed internal tools and took over accounts belonging to Elon Musk, Barack Obama, and Apple. Technical controls failed because humans were the target. Security awareness is how we transform employees from the weakest link into an active defense layer.",
    "learning_goals": [
      "Design effective security awareness programs",
      "Implement phishing simulation and training campaigns",
      "Develop role-based security training for different audiences",
      "Measure awareness program effectiveness",
      "Build a security-conscious culture"
    ],
    "why_it_matters": "Studies consistently show that 80-90% of breaches involve human error or manipulation. You can have perfect technical controls, but if an employee clicks a malicious link or shares credentials, those controls are bypassed. Security awareness addresses the human elementâ€”transforming users from vulnerabilities into sensors. Expect 3-5 Security+ questions on awareness training, phishing campaigns, and user education concepts."
