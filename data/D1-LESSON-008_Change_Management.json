    "hook": "In 2017, a routine network configuration change at a major US airline caused a massive IT outage that grounded 2,300 flights, stranded 75,000 passengers, and cost the company over $100 million. The root cause? A single contractor made an unauthorized change to a router without following change management procedures. When that change failed, there was no rollback plan, no documentation of what was changed, and no understanding of the cascade effects. Change is inevitable in IT environmentsâ€”but uncontrolled change is the enemy of both availability and security.",
    "learning_goals": [
      "Explain why change management is critical for both security and availability",
      "Apply formal change management processes including CAB approval and documentation",
      "Conduct security impact assessments for proposed changes",
      "Implement version control and rollback capabilities for security configurations",
      "Distinguish between standard, emergency, and automated changes"
    ],
    "why_it_matters": "Change management appears deceptively simple but has profound security implications. Every misconfiguration that leads to a breach, every patch that introduces a vulnerability, and every system update that breaks security controls involves change. As a security professional, you'll review change requests for security impact, participate in CAB meetings, and ensure rollback plans exist. The Security+ exam tests change management conceptsâ€”expect 3-5 questions on processes, documentation, and security considerations."

Closure*\n- Document actual results\n- Update CMDB/configuration records\n- Post-implementation review\n- Lessons learned\n\n**Types of Changes**\n\n*Standard Changes*\n- Pre-approved, low-risk, routine changes\n- Follow documented procedures\n- Don't require individual CAB approval\n- Examples: password resets, scheduled patches, user provisioning\n\n*Normal Changes*\n- Follow full change management process\n- Require impact assessment and approval\n- Scheduled during change windows\n- Most changes fall into this category\n\n*Emergency Changes*\n- Bypass normal approval for urgent issues\n- Still documented and reviewed after the fact\n- Used for security incidents, outages\n- Expedited approval by designated authority\n\n*Automated Changes*\n- Executed by systems without human intervention\n- Pre-approved through policy\n- Examples: auto-scaling, automated patching\n- Require careful policy definition",

When one person can submit, approve, AND implement changes, they could make unauthorized changes without oversight. While least privilege might also be a concern, the primary issue is the lack of separation in the change process."
