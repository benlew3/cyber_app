    "hook": "In 2017, a routine network configuration change at a major US airline caused a massive IT outage that grounded 2,300 flights, stranded 75,000 passengers, and cost over $100 million. The root cause? A single contractor made an unauthorized change without following change management procedures. When the change failed, there was no rollback plan, no documentation, and no understanding of cascade effects. Change is inevitableâ€”but uncontrolled change is the enemy of both availability and security.",
