  "introduction": {
    "hook": "In 2021, a fire at OVH's data center in Strasbourg, France destroyed one data center entirely and damaged another. Millions of websites went offline. Some customers lost their data permanently because they relied on the provider for backupsâ€”backups that were stored in the same facility that burned. The lesson was clear: 'the cloud' is just someone else's computer, in someone else's building. True resilience requires understanding your recovery capabilities and testing them before disaster strikes.",
    "learning_goals": [
      "Design high availability architectures using redundancy and load balancing",
      "Implement backup strategies aligned with business requirements",
      "Develop disaster recovery plans with appropriate RPO and RTO targets",
      "Understand business continuity planning and its components",
      "Apply resilience concepts to protect against various failure scenarios"
    ],
    "why_it_matters": "Organizations depend on technology for operations, and disruptions can be catastrophic. Security professionals design resilient systems, implement backup strategies, and develop recovery plans. Whether facing ransomware, natural disasters, or system failures, resilience determines whether an organization survives. Expect 5-7 Security+ questions on backup types, HA concepts, disaster recovery, and business continuity."
