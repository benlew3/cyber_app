    "hook": "In 2020, SolarWindsâ€”a trusted IT management software vendorâ€”unknowingly distributed malware to 18,000 customers including US government agencies and Fortune 500 companies through a compromised software update. The attackers didn't breach these organizations directly; they compromised a trusted third party. This supply chain attack demonstrated that your security is only as strong as your weakest vendor. Third-party risk isn't theoreticalâ€”it's how some of the most devastating breaches occur.",
    "learning_goals": [
      "Implement a comprehensive third-party risk management program",
      "Conduct vendor security assessments using questionnaires and reviews",
      "Evaluate and monitor vendor security throughout the relationship",
      "Manage supply chain security risks effectively",
      "Establish contractual security requirements and right-to-audit clauses"
    ],
    "why_it_matters": "Modern organizations depend on hundreds of vendors, suppliers, and partnersâ€”each representing a potential security risk. A breach at any third party with access to your data or systems can become your breach. Regulations increasingly require third-party risk management (PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR). Security professionals must understand how to assess, monitor, and manage these risks. Expect 4-6 Security+ questions on vendor risk assessment, supply chain security, and contractual requirements."
