    "hook": "What if instead of just defending against attackers, you could trick them into revealing themselves while they waste time attacking fake systems? That's the power of deception technology. When attackers breach your network, they expect to find real servers, real data, and real vulnerabilities. Deception technologies present convincing fakes that have no legitimate business useâ€”meaning any interaction is immediately suspicious. It's like setting traps throughout your network that attackers can't distinguish from real systems.",

      "Differentiate between honeypots, honeynets, honeytokens, and honeyfiles",

      "Analyze attacker behavior captured through deception systems",
      "Understand how fake telemetry and DNS sinkholes disrupt attackers"
    ],
    "why_it_matters": "Deception technologies provide unique value: they have near-zero false positive rates (legitimate users have no reason to interact with decoys), they waste attacker resources, and they provide early warning of breaches. As a security professional, you'll deploy honeypots, analyze attacker behavior, and integrate deception into your detection strategy. The Security+ exam covers deception technologies as part of security architectureâ€”expect 2-3 questions on types and use cases."

INTEGRATION: All alerts feed to SIEM with high priority, SOC has playbook specifically for deception alerts, quarterly reviews assess coverage gaps. RESULTS: In year one, honeytokens detected two policy violations and one actual intrusion attempt. The intrusion was detected 6 hours into attacker dwell timeâ€”before any lateral movement to real systems. Traditional controls hadn't detected anything."

Experienced attackers can identify honeypots that stand outâ€”different naming conventions, unrealistic configurations, or suspicious placement. Effective honeypots must be indistinguishable from real systems. Zero-days wouldn't prevent attackers from interacting with honeypots."
