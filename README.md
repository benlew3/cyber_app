<h2> The purpose of this app is to help people get a basic understanding of the Cybersecurity frameowrk</h2>
<h3> The goal is to teach the basics of what the CompTIA Security+ exam would want their test takers to know. This is not comprehensive but is more to test your knowledge through the quizzes as well as simulations.<br>
This app is more focused on simulations and quizzes as well as a mock exam. There is a career quiz to see which aspect of cybersecurity you could potentially be a best fit for based on interest as well as current job situation.
